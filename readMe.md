### IdeaBox

## Abstract
We built an IdeaBox to store and display user-submitted ideas. These ideas can be starred(favorited) and deleted, and the starred ideas can be accessed as a separate view.

## Installation Instructions
To get this app running, clone it down from GitHub under the "<> Code" dropdown.  
Open it from your terminal or preferred CLI with git clone <HTTPS or SSH key>.   
Move into the directory, open the file in your code editor of choice, and you'll have everything you need!   
The app can be viewed and interacted with in your browser of choice by using `open index.html` in your terminal.  
Have fun creating ideas and using IdeaBox!

## Context
This project is from Week 4, Mod 1 of the Turing Front-End Engineering Program. 3 people spent over 20 hours collectively working together and asynchronously.

## Contributors
This application was created by [Emalee Poellot](https://github.com/em2396), [Arden Ranta](https://github.com/tenthwalker), and [Deanna Sofia Stevens](https://github.com/dsstevens).

## Learning Goals
This project was intended to develop our understanding of clean HTML and CSS to match a provided comp, build team skills, practice separating the data model from the DOM, incorporate and iterate over arrays, and prioritize DRY code, SRP, and function purity.

## Wins + Challenges
# Wins
- Lots of new knowledge about the variety of ways CSS can be used to style a page!
- Gaining a deeper knowledge of Javascript by addressing complex data types and saving and deleting objects to render on the DOM.
- Getting to the fourth iteration and being able to delete cards and have them render correctly.
- Having mentor support and channels of communication open.

# Challenges
- So. many. instances. of being one step away from getting our code working and needing fresh eyes to unlock that next step.
- Understanding new styling features with overflow and grid.
- Correctly targeting the buttons on dynamic HTML created with innerHTML property. Constantly taking 2 steps forward, 1 step back.
- Working asynchronously across 6 hours of timezones.
