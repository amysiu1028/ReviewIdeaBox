### IdeaBox

## Abstract
We built an IdeaBox to store and display user-submitted ideas. These ideas can be starred(favorited) and deleted, and the starred ideas can be accessed as a separate view.

## Installation Instructions
To get this app running, clone it down from GitHub under the "<> Code" dropdown. Open it from your terminal or preferred CLI with git clone <HTTPS or SSH key>. Move into the directory, open the file in your code editor of choice, and you'll have everything you need! The app can be viewed and interacted with in your browser of choice by using `open index.html` in your terminal.
